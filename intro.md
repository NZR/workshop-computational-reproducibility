# Introduction

This is an introductory workshop. There are many more tools out there that you can use to make your work reproducible, and it is worth it to invest more time than today into obtaining habits and tools for reproducible research. Many tools are language-specific, so we will not address them for that reason, but we have linked to them as much as possible. Furthermore, this workshop is a work in progress, so we encourage you to submit tools you have discovered, for us to update this repository.
