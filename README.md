# Workshop: Introduction to Computational Reproducibility

This repository contains the documentation, exercises and datasets of the
single day workshop 'Introduction to Computational Reproducibility' at [Utrecht
University](https://www.uu.nl). The workshop is organised by [Research Data
Management Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management).

## Workshop description
Ensuring your research is reproducible can be a difficult task. Scripting your analysis is a start, but this in and of itself is no guarantee that you, or someone else, can faithfully repeat your work at a later stage. In this workshop, we will help you not only to make your work reproducible, but also to increase the efficiency of your workflow. We do this by teaching you a few good programming habits: how to set up a good project structure, how to comment well, and how to document your code so that it can be used by others. We will furthermore introduce you to Git and GitHub, which are essential tools in managing and publishing code. Reproducibility requires extra effort, but we will focus on teaching you skills that will save you much more time in the long run than they cost to implement. 

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn to become a better programmer. We will take you through a project  from research question to published code in a single (admittedly intense, but fun!) day. At the end of this day you will know: 

- How to set up and use an efficient project structure, and make it easily replicable; 
- How to document your code well; 
- How to use Git for version control, and GitHub to publish your code; 
- How to license and release your code to ensure maximum reusability. 
 
The workshop is language-independent in principle. We do require participants to have at least a basic understanding of a programming language like Python or R. If you are unsure if the language you use will fit our course, please get in touch before registration.
