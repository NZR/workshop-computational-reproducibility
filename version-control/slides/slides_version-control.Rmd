# Why do you need version control?

.pull-left[

- It will help you manage ~~your code~~ most of your files (it is like track changes on steroids: it applies to all files in a folder).

- It allows you to trace back your steps: if something breaks, you can figure out what happened.

- NO MORE thesis_final_final_SERIOUSLYFINAL.Rmd

even better:
- a good version control system allows you to collaborate and share!

- a good version control system facilitates experimentation!

# What is git?
- Distributed Version Control system written by Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame)

- Allows you to log updates, branch your work (so you can experiment without losing the original!), and keep all backups, while efficiently using your storage

- Gives user a lot of control on what to track, and adds a narrative to changes ('commit comments')

- Current standard for code

- Open Source software written for the command line...

- ... but many GUI-clients exist nowadays, and most coding IDEs have built-in git.]

# Starting with git

1. (You should have installed git by now! If you have not: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).)

1. Navigate to your project folder in a terminal.
```
cd [path/to/project_folder]
```
1. Initiate a git repository in this location:
```
git init
```
1. Add all your files to the staging area:
```
git add *
```
1. Commit all the files in the staging area to your repository:
```
git commit -m "First commit"
```

---
# Connecting to github

1. Go to your github account and add a new repository (click '+', then 'New repository'):

   ![new-repo](slides_version-control_files/figure-html/screenshots/github_add_repo.png)

1. Fill out the information for your new repository. DO NOT initialize the repository yet!

  ![initialize](slides_version-control_files/figure-html/screenshots/initialize.png)
  
1. Set the origin of your local repository to the URL of your repo on github:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:[youraccount]/[yourrepo].git
```


---
# Pushing to github

You can now push the content of your local repository to the one on github:

```
git push -u origin master
```

Congrats, your local repository now has an online representation!

![octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png) \\\_\_\_ _THANK YOU!_

Take a look at your online repository. Who is the author of your commits? If it is not you, you can configure git to use your identity (make sure github knows this email address):
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

---
# Your workflow

1. Add the changed file(s) to the staging area, and commit the changes:
```
git add src/filename.py anotherfile.txt config/configfile.json
git commit -m "My commit message"
```
OR
1. commit files directly:
```
git commit src
```

NB: don't forget your commit message (try what happens if you do!).

# What else can I do with git?

Check the status of your repository:
```
git status
```
Check the log of your previous commits:
```
git log
git log --oneline
```
What differences are there between your last commit and your workspace? (Or between two previous commits...)
```
git diff
git diff HEAD~3
```
SO much more!
```
git --help
```

# .gitignore

The .gitignore file in your template contains files that **by definition** will not be tracked by git.

For example, if you do not want to track a file .DS_Store (always present on my mac), you enter a line like this in your .gitignore file:
```
.DS_Store
```
Similarly, you can ensure all output in a folder will not be tracked:
```
results/
```
Or all files with a certain extension:
```
*.dat
```

# Your turn!

Continue moving your files to the file template.
- Add, commit, and push all your **relevant** files.
