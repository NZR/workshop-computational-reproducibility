# Why code documentation?

* ## You want yourself to understand how code written some time ago works.

* ## You want others to understand how to re-use your code

## For this you need to 
* ## Explain parts of your code with comments
* ## Explain what to install in your readme
* ## Explain how to use your code in a Notebook

## Code documentation

You can document:

- How to use your code with dynamic documents
  - RMarkdown documents
  - Jupyter notebooks
  
- What your code does with inline comments, in the source code
  - Inline comments
  - Structured documentation strings
  
- What to install
  - Readme.md shown on the main page of git repositories
  - Requirements.txt in python
  - Packrat in R, sessionInfo writelines, checkpoints
  - RTools in R https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/
  - Sphinx for Python

## Dynamic documents

Dynamic documents combine text (=human reader) with code chunks (=machine)


```{python}
# Running python in an RMarkdown document 
# requires the package reticulate
who_am_i = "Python"

print(f"I said I am {who_am_i}")
```
