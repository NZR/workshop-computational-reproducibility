# Project documentation

#### Why do you need documentation?

- You want yourself to understand how code written some time ago works

- You want others to understand how to (re-)use your code

--

#### For this you need to 
- Explain parts of your code with __comments__

- Explain what to install and how to get started in your __readme__
- Explain in-depth use of your code in a __notebook__


---
# Comments
#### Comments are annotations you write directly in the code source.
.pull-left[
They:

- are written for users who deal with your source code

- explain parts that are not intuitive from the code itself

- **do not** replace readable or structured code

- (in a specific structure) can be used to directly generate documentation for users.

# When *not* to use comments

- ...to repeat in natural language what is written in your code

```R
# Now we check if the age of a patient is greater than 18
if(agePatient > 18)

```
--
- ...to turn old code into zombie code (fine for troubleshooting, but do not leave it in!)

```R
# Do not run this!!
# itDoesNotWork <- optimizeMulticoreDeepLearning(myProteins)
# if(itDoesNotWork == 1444){
#    connection <- connectToHPC(currentUser, password)
#}
```
--
- ...to replace version control, like git

```R

# removed on August 5
# if() ...

#Now, it connects to the API with o-auth2, updated 05/05/2016
...
```

# Comment lines: WHY over HOW

Comment lines are used to explain the **purpose** of some piece of code.
```python
# Bug fix GH 20601
# If the data frame is too big, the number of unique index combination
# will cause int32 overflow on windows environments.
# We want to check and raise an error before this happens
num_rows = np.max([index_level.size for index_level in self.new_index_levels])
num_columns = self.removed_level.
```

# Docstrings

- Structured comments, associated to *segments* (rather than lines) of code can be used to generate documentation for users*  of your project.

- These comments are called *docstrings*.

- Docstrings, unlike regular comments, are parsed by the interpreter, and can be used as code metadata.

- Docstrings allow you to provide documentation to a function, that is relevant to the user of that function.




.footnote[*) Remember? That's probably you!]

# A glimpse into code generation

- Need additional tools:

  * http://www.doxygen.nl/ : c++ (and many more languages)
  * http://www.sphinx-doc.org/ : Python
  * https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/ : R

An example with Roxygen:

```R
#' A function that says hello
#'
#' @return Nothing
#' @export
#' @examples
#' hello()

hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

Note the special symbols which differ from standard comment lines.

Namely, the #' and @ : these are special symbols that are recognized by
---
# A glimpse into code generation

In the console, in RStudio, run the following command:

```R
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

.pull-left-larger[
The commande above will create documentation files that can be visualized by calling help(your package)

# Readme

The contents typically include one or more of the following:

From wikipedia's [Readme]("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=README&oldid=923233067") page

> - __Configuration instructions__
- __Installation instructions__
- __Operating instructions__
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments

# Readme how?

- Readme are files that can be written as text (or markdown for formatting)

- Github will show the content of your readme file at the root of the repository

- When you create a repository on Github, there in an option to include a Readme files

# Notebooks

Notebooks originates from the concept of literate programming, introduced by D. Knuth in 1984.

- Idea : describe the logic of the code in natural language and include source code at the same time
- In one document from the original program can be generated
- Nowadays, literate programming evolved into Jupyter notebooks, RMarkdown documents etc.

---
# Editing notebooks

In notebooks, you have two parts:

- Text (now often in markdown, LaTex or plain text)
- Code (Python, R ...)

This means

- That there are text chuncks
- And code chunks

All chunck can be run at the same time
- Text chunks will be shown
- Code chunks will be executed and their ouput will be shown (if any)

---
# Notebook software

- RStudio with R notebooks

- Jupyter lab with jupyter notebooks

- Come code editors/integrated development environments can run notebooks
  - Pycharm, Rstudio, Visual studio ...

>This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
>
>Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

>```r

# Your turn!
- Do you have any "bad" comments in your code : remove or edit them
  - Unecessary
  - Deactivated code
  - Git like comments
- Make a readme explaining What people should know to run your code again
  - Install extra tools, dependencies
  - Which environment (Python? R? and which version)
  - The main scripts that should executed
- Make a notebook
  - Describe how to use the package to analyse the data you have
  - Write in the notebook a brief introduction explaining the purpose of your script
  - Then show how to use your package and what kind of outputs it produce
  - For example, if your code has produced figures of table before (e.g., publication), show how to produce these tables again
