# Who are you? What brings you here?

Present yourself in this collaborative document: [tinyurl.com/repcodoc-2020-03-24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0FmLR3kQfGW0Qpqbo4FZQJLhlEryKEPm7Fuinr3ZVk/edit?usp=sharing)

- Your name
- Your affiliation
- Your pronouns

Maybe add something about yourself:
- What drew you most to this workshop today?
- What can others ask you about?
- Something exciting you discovered recently?
- What book you're reading / show you're watching / music you're listening to ...
- _or anything else!_

# How to ask for help?

#### What you can do:
- Use the Zoom chat to ask questions (*preferred!*)
- Put an X in the purple column of the status chart (page 2 of [tinyurl.com/repcodoc-2020-03-24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0FmLR3kQfGW0Qpqbo4FZQJLhlEryKEPm7Fuinr3ZVk/edit?usp=sharing)) (*if you are stuck but don't know why*)

#### What we will do:
- Helpers will answer you in a public or private chat on Zoom
- OR: helper posts a link to an individual google hangout, where they can assist you.

---
# General guidelines (and advice!)
- Ask for help when you need it, and alert us when we need to slow down!

--

- Please mute yourself when you are not speaking (bottom right side of your Zoom window).

--

- We appreciate your video, but only share if you are comfortable.

--

- Use the green column of the status chart when you finished an exercise.

--

- Close as many unnecessary windows and programs as possible.

--

- Take a computer break when we take a break: a timer will show when we return!

# Be Reproducible!
.pull-left-medium[
What is reproducibility?

- **computationally reproducible** means: with same code + same data + same environment
== same results

- Not the same as **replication**, where _different_ methods and _different_ data lead to the same research findings

Why make your work reproducible?

- for other scientists building on your work.

- for colleagues using your tools.

- for yourself, in six months!

# Making a start
![example](images/screenshots/badexample.png)

---
# Is this enough?

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the enviroment)

How confident do you feel?
--

> This code is a kludgly, ugly, inefficient mess. 
(...)
>  It is probably riddled with problems, mistakes, bugs, inefficiencies, vestigial code stubs, etc etc.
(...)
> I am as confident as I am capable of being that all of the factual claims that were made in the manuscript are accurate.

--

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.
- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow *itself* is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.


---
# What will we do today?

We will take you through a workflow (in a broad sense!)

--

- Setting up a project

- Establishing a robust backup / version control system

- Writing good code

- Writing documentation

- Making your project accessible

--

We will end by trying to reproduce each others' projects!



---
# What do we expect from you?

- Our group today has many different abilities and experiences. We hope you will value this as much as we do!

- Feel free and safe to share your expertise and experiences.

- E.g.: if you do not know a certain word or term (or you think others may not know it): put it in the glossary; if you do: fill in the blanks!

--

#### Our objectives for you
We want to teach you **good habits** that will make your work more accessible, trustworthy, and reproducible by others. In doing so, we have tried to identify those habits that are a **good return on investment**: meaning, they save you time in the not-so-long run.

### And finally: we hope you enjoy the day!
