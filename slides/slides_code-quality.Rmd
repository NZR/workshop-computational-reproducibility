# Code readability

- Code is for computer, comments are for humans.

# Code readability

- ~~Code is for computer, comments are for humans.~~

- Use whitespace and newlines strategically.

--

#### Compare:
```r
this <- function(arg1,arg2){res<-arg1*arg2;return(res)}
hurts <- mean(c(this(3,4),this(3,1),this(9,9))); print(hurts)
```

```r
this <- function(arg1,arg2){
  res <- arg1 * arg2
  return(res)
}

hurts <- mean(
  c(
    this(3,4),
    this(3,1),
    this(9,9)
    )
  )
print(hurts)
```

# Code readability

- ~~Code is for computer, comments are for humans.~~

- Use whitespace and newlines strategically.

- use descriptive names for functions and variables
  - start functions with a verb
  - make variable names _just_ long enough to be meaningful

--

#### Compare:

```python
for i in my_shopping_basket:
  if(test(i)) > 10:
    purch(i)
  else:
    disc(i)
```

```python
for item in basket:
  if(testNecessity(item)) > 10:
    purchase(item)
  else:
    discard(item)
```

- ~~Code is for computer, comments are for humans.~~

- Use whitespace and newlines strategically.

  - start functions with a verb
  - make variable names _just_ long enough to be meaningful

- use a consistent style
  - consistency will make your code easier to understand and maintain
  - consult a styleguide for your language (keep conventions, and don't reinvent the wheel)

# Code robustness (part 1)

- Separate code and data: don't hard code variables!

  - and if you must...
  - Do it once, e.g. weeklength = 7
  - Consider using a config file for project-specific (meta)data!
  
- Don't repeat yourself: use functions

 - Write routines in functions, ie., code you reuse often
 - Change hard coded values by arguments in your functions
 - Identify potential functions by their action: functions perform tasks (e.g. sorting, plotting, saving a file, transform data...)

---
# Functions

Functions are smaller code units reponsible of one task.

- Functions are meant to be reused

- Functions accept arguments (values)

- What arguments a function accept is defined by its parameters

```python
def sort_data(data, how="asc", column=0):
  raise NotImplementedException("Ooops")
  
try:
  sort_data(protein_data)
except Exception as ex:
  logger.log("It went wrong")
```
---
# Code reusability

- Modular code is reusable code

  - One script for one purpose
  - Document clearly what comes in and what comes out
  - When using (adjustable) parameters in your code, use a config file that can be adjusted *outside* of your code

--

- Consider the modularity of your functions
  - Separate functions into generic and specific elements
  - Generic part can and will be reused
  - Specific elements are unique applicable in specific situations

--
  
- Do One Thing (and do it well)
  - One function for one purpose
  - One class for one purpose
  - One script for one purpose (no fishing to recycle it!)

---
# Your turn

Take a look at your code.
- Are you repeating yourself: do you have repeated code that could be a function?

- Can you separate a function into generic and specific elements?

- Is there hard coded data or adjustable parameters that you can extract (perhaps in a config file?)

- Would your script be more reusable if you split it into subscripts?
  
- Finally: read your code. Ignore the comments. 
  - Is it clear what you mean? What can you rewrite?
  - Do you have difficulty interpreting variables or function names in your code? Rename them
  - Are you constructively using whitespace?
  - What does your styleguide say about CamelCase, separators_like_these or-like-these, etc..? Take a look and see if you can apply some things!

# Towards defensive programing

- Error management
 - Check values before processing them
  - Make use of try/catch mechanisms to manage exceptions
  - Make use of logging tools instead of print functions

- Do not expect users to treat your code like you expected, so expect the worst
 - use of wrong input values using your functions
 - data types
 - malformed text input

- Make use of systematic tests
 - Unit testing (event if you work alone on your code)
 - Continuous integration (if many authors work on code)

---
# Error management

- Check values with if/else

```python
if not protein_data:
  raise ValueError("Dataset cannot be empty")
```

- With try catch (called except in Python)

```python
try:
  do_something_that_might_go_wrong(protein_data)
except ItWentWrongException as ex:
  logger.log(ex)
finally:
  protein_data.to_csv("../data/processed/proteins.csv")
```

# Unit testing
Unit testing is a generic testing approach.

Your software is tested by focusing on smaller units, for instance a series of functions or class.

Extra packages\\imports are needed

- in R with the testthat/testthis packages
  - https://github.com/r-lib/testthat, https://github.com/r-lib/testthis
- in python with pytest, unittest
  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

# Running unit tests
__Code editors/IDEs__ such as visual studio code, RStudio, Pycharm...

- Integrate functionalities to run and show the results of unit tests
  - E.g., RStudio in the build menu -> test package
  
1. Create a unittest file
  
  ```R
  usethis::use_test("hello")
  ```
  
2. Edit the file test-hello.R in the tests folder (created by usethis)
  
  ```R
  test_that("multiplication works", {
    expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
  })
  ```
  
3. Run tests
  - In RStudio using the menu __or__
  ```R
    devtools::test()
  ```
