# Getting started

.pull-left[
- Contain your project in a single recognizable folder

- Distinguish folder _types_, name them accordingly:
  - **Read-only**: data, metadata
  - **Human-generated**: code, paper, documentation
  - **Project-generated**: clean data, figures, models...
  
- Initialize a **README** file, document your project

- Choose a **license**

- Publish your project.]

# Cookiecutter

You can set up a project template using a nifty tool called cookiecutter.

First, ensure you have cookiecutter installed:
```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

This is the recommended installation method. BUT if you do not have pip, there are a few alternatives:
The pip-predecessor easy_install:
```bash
easy_install --user cookiecutter
```
MacOS X with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install cookiecutter
```
Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install cookiecutter
```

> A command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (project templates). e.g. creating a Python package project from a Python package project template.

> _[cookiecutter.readthedocs.io](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)_

There are MANY templates available for your purposes. [Take a look!](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

We have designed a template based on [this paper by Wilson _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) (2017). Go ahead and install it!

```bash
cookiecutter gh:bvreede/good-enough-project
```

Answer the questions cookiecutter asks you, and browse the resulting project to see where your answers ended up.

# Your turn

- Place your project files in the right folder.
- Adjust paths in your code, and be sure to use **relative, not absolute** paths!

# Choosing a license

- Copyright is implicit; others cannot use your code without your permission.

- Licensing gives that permission, and its boundaries and conditions.

- Choosing a license early on means being aware of your license as the project proceeds (and not creating conflicts).

- There are over [80 OSI-approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) (and [many](http://dbad-license.org), [many](http://www.wtfpl.net) others) to choose from.

This is one I like to use:

What is important to you? What does your lab use? [Choose your own license!](http://choosealicense.com)

# Publishing your project

Uh... Isn't 'publication' the thing you do... _at the end?_ 

--

No! Publishing your project at an early stage
- forces you to consider readability throughout
- minimizes the mess you have to deal with when you (finally) decide to publish
- allows collaboration and support
- facilitates sharing and re-use.

--

_But I have sensitive data!_

Then don't include your data in your software repository (that's not what they are for anyway).

--

_Sure, but my code references my data!_

Yeah that's not good. Don't do that.

--

_Also what if someone scoops my code! I'm a revolutionary, they will steal my ideas!_

If you are super paranoid, you can always opt for a private repository.

# Where do I publish?
.pull-left-larger[
### Living project: github
(or other social coding platform):

- synergistic with version control software git

- makes history public and accessible _(eek!)_

- allows publication of different releases

- provides a platform for interaction and collaboration

### Archiving a release: zenodo
(or other stable repository, like the [OSF](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2018-uutah-repro/the-open-science-framework.html))
- [direct archiving supported](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) from github to zenodo

- this gives you a doi: your code is citeable!
